Explanation for task 2.

The proper solution for this task is to find a time when the distance between planes are minimal, and then find a distance between points at that moment of time. time complexity of this algorithm ~O(1) (constant).
We need to use a formula that we can get by differentiation of distance formula, but I am stuck a bit here.

My current solution is the implementation of brute force algorithm that checking distance at every discrete moment with interval 1. Thus, result output could be not so precise. Time complexity of this algorithm is ~O(N) (linear).
