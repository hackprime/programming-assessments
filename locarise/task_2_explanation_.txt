Explanation for task 2.

The proper solution for this task is to find a time when the distance between planes are minimal,
and then find a distance between points at that moment.
Time complexity of this algorithm is ~O(1) (constant).
We need to use a formula that we can get by differentiation of distance formula,
but I am stuck a bit here.

My current solution is the implementation of brute force algorithm that checking distance
at every discrete moment with interval 1. Thus, output result may be not so precise.
Time complexity of this algorithm is ~O(N) (linear).
